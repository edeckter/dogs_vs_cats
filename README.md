# Dogs vs. Cats
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with Python code for solving the classification problem of identifying whether images contain a dog or a cat.  The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) for this problem comes from Kaggle.

The code is adapted from Francois Challet's *Deep Learning with Python*.
